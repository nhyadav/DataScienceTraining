Python Basics
---------------
### Variables & Data Types ###
In python, everything is an object. Including integers, floats, strings, booleans etc, they are all objects.In python variables are used to store values. They can hold different types of data which we call as data types. The most commonly used data types
In python we can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=). The variable name is called an identifier.

<br>

###  Operators ###
There are mainly two types of operators arithmetic ( +,-,*,/ ) and comparison( ==, !=  , >,<).

<br>

###  Control Flow ###
Control flow statements are used to direct the program's execution depending upon certain conditions. There are Control flow statements decide the order in which the program executes. They include if else statement Control Flow, for Control Flow, while Control Flow.

<br>

### Functions ###   
Function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It takes input and produces output. They can be defined using def keyword followed by function
Function is a block of code which can be called again using its name. It helps in organizing the code and makes it reusable.

<br>

### Modules and Packages  ###
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The contents of a module are accessed using the import and calling the particular content.

<br>

###  Object Oriented Programming ###
Classes are user defined blueprint for creating objects which hold related information together inside a single entity. 

<br>

###  File Handling ###
To read file we use open() function which returns a file object.
We can also specify mode in which file is opened 'r' for reading 'w' for writing 'a' for appending.
f.read(),f.write(),f.close().

<br>

### Advanced  Topics ###
- List Comprehension : It is an elegant way to create lists based on existing list.
- Dictionary Comprehension : It is similar to List Comprehension but it creates Dictionary.
- Regular Expressions : A sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. They are used for string manipulation.
- Lambda  functions: They are small anonymous functions which can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.

## Numpy and Pandas Basic Operation. ##

**Numpy** is the library developed bynumpy foundation for the Python programming language that supports array-oriented operations.**NumPy** is the library for numerical operations and mathematical operations.

**Pandas** is the library for  data manipulation and analysis in Python.
